# PONG

Making a very basic game to continue learning Rust and Macroquad.
Gradually going to add crates and techniques that are more complicated.

## Ideas / Planning

1. Score in top corner beside each player, or in the center with a white line
   down the middle.
2. Names in top corner beside each player or other zone where score is.

3. Spash screens for gamestart, settings, gameend, gamemodes and gameplay.
4. different game modes (insanity, solo, solo-insanity, easy, normal)
5. increment player speed by 25 every 10 seconds

Have a solo mode where the player controls both paddles with one set
of controls, and they are basically competeing against their self.
to get the highest amount of passes.
