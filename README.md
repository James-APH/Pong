# PONG

Making a very basic game to continue learning Rust and Macroquad.
Gradually going to add crates and techniques that are more complicated.

## Ideas / Planning

1. Score in top corner beside each player, or in the center with a white line
   down the middle.
2. Names in top corner beside each player or other zone where score is.

3. Spash screens for gamestart, gameplay, and game end.

4. increment player speed by 25 every 10 seconds
